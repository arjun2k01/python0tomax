# typecasting is the process of converting one data type to another data type.
# type() is a built-in function in Python that returns the data type of an object.


#  Practise set 2 :
# Write a Python Program to add two numbers 
# a=45
# b=23
# print("The sum of",a,"and",b,"is",a+b)
# # sum is 68

#  Write a program to find the remainder when a number is divided by z
# a=10
# z=3
# print("The remainder when",a,"is divided by",z,"is",a%z)
# remainder is 1

# Check The type of variable assigned using input() function .
# a= input("Enter a number: ")
# b=input("Enter a string: ")
# print("The type of variable assigned using input() function is",type(a),"and",type(b))
# output : The type of variable assigned using input() function is <class'str'> and <class'str'>

# use a comparison operator to find out whether a given variable greater than b or not . take a= 34 and b=80;
# a = 55;
# b=45;
# if a>b:
#     print(a,"is greater than",b)
# else:
#     print(b,"is greater than",a)
#     print(a>b)
# output : 55 is greater than 45

# Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
# a= int(input("Enter the first number: "))
# b= int(input("Enter the second number: "))
# average = (a+b)/2
# print("The average of",a,"and",b,"is",average)

# Write a python Program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

# a= int(input("Enter a number: "))
# print("The square of",a,"is",a**2)
